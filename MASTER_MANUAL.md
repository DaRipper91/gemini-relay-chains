# 🥒 DaRipper91 Ecosystem: Master User Manual

Welcome to the central knowledge hub for the DaRipper91 digital empire. This manual provides the "honest and wholeful truth" about every system and repository under our command.

## 🏛️ I. THE HARDWARE LOCK

This ecosystem is architected around specific hardware anchors. Do not attempt high-compute tasks on mobile spokes.

### ⚓ Anchor: Da-HP
*   **Model**: HP EliteDesk 800 G1 DM
*   **Specs**: Intel i7-4790S | 16GB RAM | AVX2
*   **OS**: CachyOS (Arch Linux) | linux-tkg-pds
*   **Role**: Primary build server, persistent compute, and VNC/RDP gateway.

### 📱 Controller: Pixel 9 (Android/Termux)
*   **Role**: Mobile orchestration. Uses `gemini-cli-termux` for system management on the move.
*   **Constraint**: Restricted syscalls; battery-sip mode prioritized.

### 🧪 Test Bench: Nothing Phone (2a) - "Pacman"
*   **SoC**: MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro
*   **Role**: Specialized Android engineering, MediaTek modding, and BROM recovery testing.

## 📁 II. REPOSITORY REGISTRY

Every project in this organization serves a specific tier in our automation logic.

### 🔎 Intelligence Tiers
*   **`da-omni-scout`**: The 8-5-4 Standard manual generator. Harvests system intel recursively.
*   **`gemini-relay-chains`**: Defines the standards for multi-agent workflows (this manual).

### 🛠️ Execution Tiers
*   **`automatic-tribble`**: TUI for managing files between Termux and Android shared folders.
*   **`fish-config`**: Optimized shell configuration with `secrets.fish` isolation.
*   **`termux-ai-manager`**: AI-powered maintenance toolkit for Android/Termux environments.

## ⚡ III. OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS

1.  **Anti-Drift**: If an AI agent provides an ungrounded answer, command a "Hard Reset."
2.  **Relay Handoff**: Every complex task must pass through a 6-tier chain (Intelligence -> Analysis -> Architecture -> Synthesis -> Validation -> Documentation).
3.  **AI-Ready**: Every repo must be standardized via `repomix` for XML context packing.
4.  **.bak Recovery**: Before editing config files in system or hidden folders, search for a `.bak` file. If none exists, create one immediately. Never delete the fallback.
